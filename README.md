# Use-Hugging-Face-Pretrained-Model

Hugging Face has become a prominent player in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), providing a range of pre-trained models that can be used in different applications. If we need to do tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation or any other NLP task, Hugging Face's pre-trained models make it easier for us.

This article will discuss the fundamentals of using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face including loading, performing inference and a hands-on example with code.

What is Hugging Face?
Hugging Face is a company and an open-source community that has revolutionized NLP. It provides tools to download and use pretrained models like GPT, BERT, RoBERTa and more making it easier for developers to work with advanced models without starting from scratch.

The Hugging Face library includes models for:

Text classification
Named entity recognition (NER)
Question answering
Text generation
Machine translation
Installing Hugging Face Transformers
The real power of Hugging Face lies in its Transformers library that provides seamless integration with pre-trained models. Before using Hugging Face models, ensure you have the transformers library installed. Run the following command to install it:

!pip install transformers

Getting started with Hugging Face's Pre-trained Models
Pretrained models are models that have undergone training on large datasets and can be adjusted for specific purposes without further training. The library transformers by Hugging Face contains many models in different categories like text classification, token classification, translation, summarization and others.

Using pre-trained models such as BERT, GPT and T5 enables the execution of tasks with minimal configuration. Hugging Face offers models trained in various languages and for different tasks. Its steps include:
